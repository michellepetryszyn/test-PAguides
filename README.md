Purpose:
18F Acquisitions needs CORs on a multitude of projects to perform contract administration delegated by the CO, accept work and provide guidance to the vendors. So far, we’ve had many different types of team members play this role with a big variance on what CORs are responsible for and how this job is performed. 

Billy Griffin asked Michelle and Rebecca to do some research on what a COR should look like on the External Buy team and who that COR should be.
